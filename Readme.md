# 3lbsofSalt's Dotfiles

Enjoy these dotfiles! Below are some things to watch out for:

### How To Use
Navigate to the root directory and execute `stow [DIRECTORY NAME]` where `DIRECTORY NAME` is the name of
the directory for the tool or program you would like to configure

#### _Theme Files

These files generally contain a wallpaper and a polybar config.
The fehbg file needs to be changed to reflect the username of the directory stow is stored in.

#### CLI tools I Think I like, but I don't want to make default
